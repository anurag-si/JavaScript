// we have an array with the name and surname
let arr = ["John", "Smith"]

// destructuring assignment
// sets firstName = arr[0]
// and surname = arr[1]
let [firstName, surname] = arr;

alert(firstName); // John
alert(surname);  // Smith

//When we pass array/object to a funtion it may not need as object/array as a whole. It may need individual pieces.
//Destructuring assignment is a special syntax that allow us to "unpack" arrays or objedcct into a bunch of variable.
