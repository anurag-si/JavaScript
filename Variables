// Scalar values
const answer= 42; //references assigned with const can not be changed
const greeting = "Hello";

//Arrays and Objects
const numbers = [2,4,6]; //values can be changed
const person ={
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
};

//variables defined with const are much better than those defined with let because you get a guarantee that value will not change
